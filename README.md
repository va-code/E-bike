# E-bike
Check out my conversion of a 1967 caf√© racer to have an electric drive
The bike is going to use an e bike hub motor: 8000W supplied at 72V. 
The motor comes with a power supply and controller so little is needed on that front.
I am going to power it with a battery module comprised of used hybrid mtteries.
I would like to use 9 nissan leaf batteries per pack to reach 72V and between 40Ah and 70Ah.
The range(in miles) will be roughly equal to the final Ah rating of the battery pack.
The motorcycle I bought had a very badly seised and rusted motor that would not have been easily saved.
The original wheels have drum brakes that will need to be refurbished on the front wheel.

# Build thus far
1. Removed the engine and old electronic equipment.
2. Dissasembled the bike down to the frame.
3. Started painting several small parts that came off near the beginning of the project.
4. 

# Modifications needed
1. Alter the rear wheel fork to allow slotting in of the hub motor.
2. Add retaining clip for rear fork.
3. Add disc brake to hub motor.
4. Alter Gas can for storage or electronics housing.


#stuff to do
1. buy batteries for pack
2. weld minor frame crack
3. sand and paint main parts
4. reupholser the seat
5. Redo lights and signals for electric system
